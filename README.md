# Server Deployment Practice
Time to get hands on with Node.js development! Today, you’ll create and deploy a web server using CI and CD and get used to the general process of building and deploying servers, and prepping your work for grading.

# Prerequisites/Dependencies:
    • Node.js
    • dotenv
    • express
    • jest
    • nodemon

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    NPM install if you are using Node.js. 
    NPM  run test to run tests
    NPM run start to start the server

- Setup a Node.js Package using npm
- Create CommonJS modules
- Create a simple express server
- See passing tests via CI using GitHub actions (Continuous Integration)
- Deploy to the cloud using CD (Continuous Deployment)
